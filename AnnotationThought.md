In JordanLee's annotation, they are talking aboutn how useful it could be to have an open notebook for all of the work that someone is doing. This would be publishing everything, not just the information that they want published, but also all of the data that they may have gathered along the way. What I liked about this was how Jordan was able to see how useful it could be to make all of this extra data public, even though there could be some scrutiny around the data that you are presenting, in the long run it would be much more helpful. Jordan realised that even though there may be some pushback from others, but the positives definitely end up outweighing the negatives of putting your data online. What struck me with this annotation is it goes to the idea that you do not need to be given something for making all of your work accessible, and that it is just good to give back to the community. In addition, if this type of approach to sharing data is taken by everyone within the Digital History community, the amount of additional data that will be available to everyone will end up helping everyone.
