                    n="MacAulay, Zachary. Negro Slavery; or, A View of Some of the More Prominent Features of that State of Society, as it Exists in the United States of America and in the Colonies of the West Indies, Especially in Jamaica. (London, 1823)"

                    We admit that various colonia acts have been framed, professing to improve the condition of the slave; 
					but they have been generally inefficient to their professed object,
					whatever other purpose they may have served.</interp> Of the Curate's Act
					of <placeName key="Jamaica" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica" >Jamaica</placeName>, for example, 
					<persName key="Cooper, Thomas" from="?" to="1880" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hibbert_(Anti-Trinitarian)">Mr. Cooper</persName>  informs us, that he had heard it
					repeatedly declared, that it was "intended for <placeName key="England" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England">England</placeName> and not for Jamaica;"
					for, he adds "it must have been known before it was passed, that under the
					peculiar circumstances existing there, such a law could have no tendency to
					improve the condition of the slaves." So, with regard to the Register Act of the 
					same island, it is impossible to red it without perceiving that it is wholly
					inoperative to the ends for which chiefly a registration of slaves was proposed.</p>
