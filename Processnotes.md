# Module 1
## Exercise 1
- Relatively simple using markdown and dilinger, by following the steps provided and copying code from the markdown cheatsheet
- https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
## Exercise 2
- when typing in passwords in the command line, it does not show your password, so you just need to type it and press enter
- https://askubuntu.com/questions/86660/i-cannot-enter-my-password-in-the-terminal-cant-install-packages
- same idea as module 1, just needed to follow the step by step commands and everything works out nicely
- cheat sheet for command https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AdvancedCommandlineHowto#Keyboard_shortcuts
## Exercise 3
- follow the commands laid out, simple stuff
## exercise 4
- everything was working well following the steps, but then my internet crapped out and I no longer have the readme.md fule ro any of the other information i did for exercise 4
- time to go back and do it all again
- not sure what is happeneing again, tried to do the <git status> command then everything dissappeared
- my internet is not working again apparently
- found better internet, life is good hopefully
- ended up deleting all of the files from the exercise from today to start from new
- in 4.2 i do not believe that i made sure to add the readme.md file to the git repository after the statu check
-  made sure to add it this time following the on screen commands <git add readme.md>
- get to the part where I am trying to do the commit
  it says "Changes not staged for commit: modified:    readme.md     no changes added to commit"
- tried moving forward to 4.3 everything still seems to be working
- checked the status of the new branch "branchone" showed that there was nothing else there, added the readme.md file to it
- making the changes now to the readme.md file
- used the git commit line right after saving the readme.md and it seems to have made a commit finally....
- tried doing the same thing again, after making changes to the file, but now it is saying "Changes not staged for commit" again...
- tried to go back to master file, came with error "Your local changes to the following files would ne overwritten by checkout" 
- so i tried to commit the new changes and it said "changes not staged for commit" again
-tried re-saving and commiting again still saying that I cannot commit the changes
- unable to get into the master branch.....
- looked through my old commands and found one to commit by using command <git commit -a>
- this command seems to have worked
- finally back on the master branch
- was able to merge the files with no problem at all, i'm happy
- saved all of the commands that i used to make everything happen up until this point
